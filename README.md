# React Flickr Gallery

This React app is a gallery that fetches images from Flickr.

When running it, it will first load by default photos taken from [this gallery](https://www.flickr.com/people/ucles17/) *(photos' credits to José María Uclés)*.

## Features

The features implemented in this gallery are the following:

- __Search functionality:__ Look for new photos on Flickr and update the gallery.
- __Photo Viewer:__ Lightbox effect to enlarge pictures and check their title. Possibility to switch within the viewer between different photos, either by using the arrow icons on both sides or the keyboard arrows.
- __Endless Scrolling:__ When scrolling down to the bottom of the page, new photos will load (if available) in batches of 20 pictures.
- __Responsive:__ UI adapted to all kind of resolutions/devices.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
